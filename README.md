# Databricks-Hackathon
This is project for Databricks Gen AI Hackathon using Mosaic AI Agentic Framework and Unity Catalogue
Problem statement ?
Procurement involves a wide range of activities, including choosing suppliers, negotiating terms, ordering, receiving, and inspecting goods, and paying invoices, to name a few. And every stage holds an array of challenges and uncertainties, kind of like walking blindfolded on a tightrope.

In order to streamline the procurement and gain more visibility into this process, the available data to be consolidated, analyzed, and value extracted to make informed decisions. Measures to be taken to restrict unwanted spending by adopting spend analytics to analyze financial / spend / invoice data and monitoring trends by integrating real-time or cadence-based data feeding.
SpentInsights is AI Agentic framework based solution which collect various data and apply analytical techniques to get actionable insights and support decision making to improve Source 2Pay operations. It helps assess your processes and find optimal answers to such business questions as
•	What are we buying?
•	In what amounts?
•	How often?
•	At what price?
•	On what terms?
•	From whom?
•	Are we getting what we need?
•	How can we reduce costs?

What is the solution developed and how?
Solution developed on Databricks platform using Mosaic AI Framework using AI Agentic workflow  providing a modular solution approach. Details as under:
•	The architecture based on RAG powered by AI Agents and Tools ,using Mosaic AI Agent Framework  and MLFlow.
•	Solution is highly scalable due to agent based approach and the underlying service being Data Lakehouse and Unity Catalogue.
What is the outcome/benefit will/can it be used for any client area?
Benefits Within EXL:
Currently within EXL , spent analytics is still evolving and there is a evident need of indepth , complex analysis of voluminous financial / spend / invoice data and monitoring trends by integrating cadence-based data feeding. This is one of the core pain points which has potential of impacting the bottom line by 30-40% 
Client Level:
Data Bridge Market Research states that “Global spend analytics market is expected to rise to an estimated value of USD 5.66 billion by 2026, registering a healthy CAGR in the forecast period of 2019-2026”. 
With cloud being adopted everywhere , there is a dire need to perform spent analytics to better manage the cost accounted due to supply chain and vendors.
